## About The App

 - The app is a clone of Google with some additional features. 
 - It allows users to search the web with ease and convenience. 
 - Upon opening or reloading the page, a new and random background image will greet the user. 
 - The app offers both Light and Dark theme options for better user experience. 
 - Users can also quickly re-search without having to return to the homepage to perform a new search.

## Technologies

 - The app was built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. 
 - Asynchronous programming was implemented through calling a Realtime-web-search API to get limited (10) web results. 
 - Tailwind CSS was used to style the layout and HTML elements. 
 - The app also utilized hooks like useState(), useEffect(), useDebounce(), useContext(), and useRef() for functionalities and state management. 
 - The loading component of 'react-loader' was used to create the Rings loading animation.

## Approach

 - The app was divided into components such as Navbar, Search, Result, Loading, and Footer. 
 - To manage dynamically changing variables, the ResultContextProvider was created using the useContext() hook of React. 
 - An array of API keys was used, and Math.random function of JavaScript was utilized to pass a random key in the header of the fetch request. 
 - This helped in reducing errors and getting results with less latency, as each API has a monthly limit.
